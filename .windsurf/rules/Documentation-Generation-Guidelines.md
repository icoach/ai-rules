- Use Markdown syntax for all documentation.
- Structure docs with clear headings: Overview, Installation, Usage, Examples, and Troubleshooting.
- Use fenced code blocks for code snippets with language tags.
- Prefer concise, clear, and professional language.
- Link to related source files using `@path/to/file.ts`.
- Avoid deprecated documentation styles such as excessive inline HTML or unsupported markdown extensions.
- Include versioning and changelog references where applicable.
- All documentation is in `docs/` folder
